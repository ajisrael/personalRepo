Slip-Days: 4 I believe. I was a little confused from the annoncement about the

Content Overview:
- fcrypt.c: This is the source code for the fcrypt application. It encrypts or
            decrypts a file and writes or reads an encrypted key to/from the key
            file depending on the invocation.
- makefile: This is my make file to compile my source code.
