This directory contains examples of encryption using OpenSSL.  The functions performed are similar to the requirements of Project 4.  Start by reading the comments in the encryption examples Enc.c and bigEnc.c.  The decryption examples Dec.c and bigDec.c take input from the output of these encryption programs.  They decryption code is less well commented, but the functionality should be straightforward to determine once the encryption examples are understood.
