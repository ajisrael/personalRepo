LOG: I decided to log the following errors:
- Open: When a file is unable to be opened I wanted to make sure it was
        identified so there would be an explaination as to why it's
        contents did not appear in spool.
- Regular: When a file is not regular I wanted to make sure it was 
           identified so there would be an explaination as to why 
           it's contents did not appear in spool. Irregular files will 
           not contain only printable characters.
- Size: When a file is too big to be read into memory I wanted to make 
        sure it was identified so there would be an explaination as to 
        why it's contents did not appear in spool. Reading in a file
        without any for of limit can be dangerous and lead to many 
        potential errors. Such as running out of memory. As well as 
        performance issues if the file is sufficiently large.
- Malloc: When the process failes to allocate memory for a file I wanted
          to make sure that reason was caputured before exiting the
          process.
- Add: When a file is successfully spooled I wanted to add that to the
       log to provide a synopsis of the success or failure of the process
- Invalid Char: When a file contains an invalid character I wanted to mark
                that specifically as the reason for not spooling, since the
                character is not printable.
TOCTOU: It is possible to have a TOCTOU error around the checks that I made on
        these files before spooling them. If someone were to change the contents
        of the file between being opened and read into memory then the size of 
        memory allocated may not be suffiecent enough or may be too much
        depending on the changes made.
