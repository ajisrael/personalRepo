We used a collaborative code editor to look at the code together. We then collaboratively
made a list of the errors in each of the functions. We then split up the issues and worked
on implementing solutions that we discussed for each error in advance.

After we all added solutions we all sat around a computer and debugged the code together.
We went through all the errors and warnings as a group.
